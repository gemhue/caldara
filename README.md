# Caldara AKA Female Caldarus (for MOMI)
(WIP) A mod for the game Fields of Mistria which changes Caldarus (male) into Caldara (female).

> [!Important]
> You will need the Mods of Mistria Installer (MOMI) to use this mod. Find MOMI [here](https://github.com/Garethp/Mods-of-Mistria-Installer).

## How to Use
1. Download this mod by clicking [here](https://github.com/gemhue/caldara/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Unzip the `.zip` file into your **Fields of Mistria** `mods` folder.
3. Run **MOMI** to install the mod `Female Caldarus`. All done!

## What does it do?
Currently, the mod only changes Caldarus' portrait sprites. The modded sprites are just slightly feminized verisons of the original sprites. I tried to make as few changed to the original sprites as possible.

> [!Note]
> In the future, I plan to create other versions of this mod which change Caldarus' name to Caldera, change his pronouns from masculine to feminine, edit his overworld sprites, and possibly more.
